      ABOUT ME
      For the past 6 years I've helped global companies, organizations and start-ups reach business goals with user focused, iterative design. I enjoy bringing clarity to complex problems with a people first approach. These programs and skills help me along the way:
      Sketch
      Adobe Suite
      HTML / CSS
      Sass
      BEM
      GitHub
      Invision App
      PROJECTS
      Pair Shaped

      The team and I designed and built a website reflecting our mission to build real-time applications that connect people and things at the moment they happen.
      Suzuki

      Concept design work for Suzuki Canada's motorcycle line. Experimenting with some new ideas to showcase products with less clutter.
      What to Hunt

      A personal project to help Canadian hunters find regulations more intuitively. What to Hunt correlates your hunting area and date to give the user relevant information.
      Departures

      An idea which was sparked by seeing a traditional departures / arrival split-flap board. I wanted to replicate the nostalgia of these.
      Hamilton Tiger-Cats

      Worked with the team to create a news focused website refresh for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.
      NOTABLES
      I've been lucky to work with some great brands, organizations, and people at my current and past jobs. Here are a few worth mentioning: TSN, Canadian Hockey League, Curling Canada, Kubota Tractors, Just Keep Livin', Government of Ontario and more.
